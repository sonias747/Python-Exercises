'''
On any given day, a pizza company offers the choice of a certain
number of toppings for its pizzas. Depending on the day, it provides
a fixed number of toppings with its standard pizzas.

Write a program that prompts the user (the manager) for the number of
possible toppings and the number of toppings offered on the standard
pizza and calculates the total number of different combinations of toppings.

Recall that the number of combinations of k items from n possibilities
is given by the formula nCk = n!/k!(nâˆ’k)!.

prompt user for number of possible toppings x

get factorial of x

get factorial of y
